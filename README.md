  Provides an easy-to-use interface (console or GUI, if applicable).

  # How It Works
   1.  A random number is generated between 1 and 6.
   2.The number is displayed to the user.

# Future Enhancements
 1.Add animations for dice rolling.
 2. Allow simulation of multiple dice rolls.
 3.Extend functionality to simulate dice with more than six faces.
